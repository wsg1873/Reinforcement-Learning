# Reinforcement-Learning
this is some method about some Reinforcement-learning
Reinforcement is problem about sequential decisions,the sequential decisions not only about the MDP,but also about the non-MDP.
according to MDP，the methods can have two class. one is Dynamic programming based on model,another is Non-model reinforcement learning.     
These method based on a example [robot looking a gold](./grid_mdp.py)  

 #Dynamic programming based on model  
 [policy iterate](./grid_policy_iterate.py)  
 [value itertate](./grid_value_itertae.py)  
 #Non-model reinforcement learning  
 [Monte Carlo method](./grid_mc.py)  
 [Time Difference](./grid_qlearning.py)
