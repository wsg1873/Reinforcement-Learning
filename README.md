# Reinforcement-Learning
this is some method about some Reinforcement-learning
Reinforcement is problem about sequential decisions,the sequential decisions not only about the MDP,but also about the non-MDP.
according to MDPï¼Œthe methods can have two class. one is Dynamic programming based on model,another is Non-model reinforcement learning.     
these method based on a example robot looking a gold-grid_mdp.py  

 ##Dynamic programming based on model  
 [policy iterate](./grid_policy_iterate.py)  
 [value itertate](./grid_value_itertae.py)  
 ##Non-model reinforcement learning  
 [Monte Carlo method](./grid_mc.py)  
 [Time Difference](./grid_qlearning.py)
